[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is the Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting, a free and non-commercial two-day weekend event that offers **all** open source contributors a place to meet, share ideas, learn and collaborate.

After 6 successful years we will host another design devroom at FOSDEM 2021 (virtually)!

The Open Source Design devroom will take place online over the weekend of 6th and 7th February 2021.

The **exact times will be confirmed in the coming months**. Due to the global health situation, FOSDEM will take place completely online.

There will be talks about design work on free, libre and open source projects.

**We invite you to send in your submissions about design work on free, libre and open source projects.**

We mean ‘design’ in the broadest sense: user research, interface and interaction design, information architecture, visual design, typography, illustration, iconography, spatial, accessibility (and anything you can think of) – all in the context of open source projects, which we believe introduces unique challenges.

Designers and developers working with designers (or on a design-minded project) are welcome to submit proposals.

Possible topics include:

- FOSS design tools
- Unique challenges that open source brings
- Design techniques and deliverables
- Design/engineering collaboration approaches
- User engagement and design research activities
- Project case studies
