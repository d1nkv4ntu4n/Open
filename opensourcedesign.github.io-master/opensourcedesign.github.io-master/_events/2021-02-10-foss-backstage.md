# FOSS Backstage 2021: Call for Participation from designers

## What is FOSS Backstage?

[FOSS Backstage](https://foss-backstage.de) is an open platform that thrives on contributions. The dedicated program committee wants to shape a program that truly is “by the community for the community”. Therefore they are looking forward to input.

They are interested in talks on:
- design in Open Source
- Open Source project leadership best practices
- community management
- Open Source project metrics
- Open Source strategy for enterprise
- adopting Open Source collaboration in corporations
- legal matters when dealing with Open Source

## Open Source Design involvement

We at Open Source Design will be helping FOSS Backstage connect with the Open Source design community to include talks and sessions about design.

We mean "design" in a broad sense -

- term typography
- graphic design
- interaction design
- user experience
- design research activities
- the use of open source software in the design practice

## What and how to submit

You can find all the information on how to submit on the [FOSS Backstage CfP website](https://foss-backstage.de/call-participation).

## Submission format

30 minute talk (This could be a 20 minute talk with 10 minutes for Q&A)

## Submission deadline

The Call for Participation closes on October, 25th (23:59 CET).

All submissions will be reviewed blindly which means that the program committee is unable to see the submitter.

Only the talk and the describing abstract is rated in order to reduce unconscious bias.

### Notifications about submission status

After all talks are rated, we will inform you about the status of your submission starting Mid-November.

## Contact and further questions

If you have further questions, see the [FOSS Backstage contact details](https://foss-backstage.de/contact).
