Based on [recommendations from The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)  and others, you’ll find symbols to communicate good hygiene and social distancing. While we can’t be like front line brave medical professionals across the globe, we hope these icons/illustrations aid in communicating some of the most important things people can do to protect themselves and their communities.

#### Free COVID-19 Awareness Icons

All solid COVID-19 illustrations are available [Open Source](https://app.biorender.com/). A trial for some period to incorporate these can be availed at [bioRENDER](https://app.biorender.com/).
Use them however you can in your signage, reports, sites, apps and projects. And please share any of your efforts – we’d love to see them and help boost awareness and helpful information.

## WHO guidelines against COVID-19 :)

* To protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. 
* Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash your hands with soap and water.
* If you use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, make sure you use and store it carefully.
* Remember that washing your hands with soap and water is also effective against COVID-19.



Stay healthy, safe, and awesome to each other, folks. Do keep washing your hands!!
